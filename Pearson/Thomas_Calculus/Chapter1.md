# Chapter 1: Functions
## 1.1 Functions and Their Graphs
- Functions are tools to describe the real world in math terms.
- Function could be represented by:
    1. equation
    2. graph
    3. numerical table
    4. verbal description

### Functions; Domain and Range
`y equals f of x`

`y = f(x)`

In this syntax, x is called independent variable, and y is called dependent variable, or output value of f at x.

> <h3>Definition</h3>
>
> A function f from a set D to a set Y is a rule that assigns a single value f(x) in Y to each x in D.

- To assign more than 1 output value y to corresponding input value x does not describe a function.
    - for example, if there is an input value 4, and possible output values are 2, and -2, this rule does not describe a function then. 
- D(f) expresses the domain of function f. That means the domain of function f, and is the set D of all possible input values of the function f.
- Range is the set of all output values of f(x) as x varies thoughtout D. This range may not include every element in the set Y.
- Domain and range of a funciton can be any sets of object. But in calculus, we deal with real numbers.

<u>Extended Notes</u>
- **Real Numbers** includes Zero, Natural Numbers, Negative Integer Numbers, Non-Integer Rational Numbers, and Irrational Numbers, where Zero and Natural Numbers also called Whole Number, Whole Number and Negative Integer Numbers consist Integers, and Integers with Non-Integer Rational Numbers become Rational Numbers. And Real Number contains both Rational Numbers and Irrational Numbers.

- **Rational Numbers** means that any number that can be written in the form of p/q.
- **Natural domain** of f means, domain of f is assumed to be the largest set of real x-values for which the formula gives real y-values.
- **Real-Valued** when the range of f(x) is a set of real numbers, the function f(x) is said to be **real-valued**.
