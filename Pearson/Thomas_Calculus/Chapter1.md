# Chapter 1: Functions
## 1.1 Functions and Their Graphs
- Functions are tools to describe the real world in math terms.
- Function could be represented by:
    1. equation
    2. graph
    3. numerical table
    4. verbal description

### Functions; Domain and Range
`y equals f of x`

$y = f(x)$

In this syntax, $x$ is called independent variable, and $y$ is called dependent variable, or output value of $f$ at $x$.

> <h3>Definition</h3>
>
> A function f from a set $D$ to a set $Y$ is a rule that assigns a single value $f(x)$ in $Y$ to each $x$ in $D$.

- To assign more than 1 output value $y$ to corresponding input value $x$ does not describe a function.
    - for example, if there is an input value 4, and possible output values are 2, and -2, this rule does not describe a function then. 
- $D(f)$ expresses the domain of function $f$. That means the domain of function $f$, and is the set $D$ of all possible input values of the function f.
- Range is the set of all output values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies thoughtout $D$. This range may not include every element in the set $Y$.
- Domain and range of a funciton can be any sets of object. But in calculus, we deal with real numbers.

<u>Extended Notes</u>
- **Real Numbers** includes Zero, Natural Numbers, Negative Integer Numbers, Non-Integer Rational Numbers, and Irrational Numbers, where Zero and Natural Numbers also called Whole Number, Whole Number and Negative Integer Numbers consist Integers, and Integers with Non-Integer Rational Numbers become Rational Numbers. And Real Number contains both Rational Numbers and Irrational Numbers.
- **Rational Numbers** means that any number that can be written in the form of p/q, where q is not Zero.
- **Natural domain** of f means, domain of f is assumed to be the largest set of real x-values for which the formula gives real y-values.
- **Real-Valued** when the range of $f(x)$ is a set of real numbers, the function $f(x)$ is said to be **real-valued**.

### Graphs of Functions

If $f$ is a function with domain $D$, its graph consists of the points in the Cartesian plane whose coordinates are the input-output pairs for $f$. In set notation, the graph is 

${(x, f(x))|x \ \epsilon \ D}$

### Representing a Function Numerically
We can have scatterplot, which is a x and y table, to represent a function.

|Time|Pressure|
|-|-|
|0.00091|-0.080|
|...|...|

### The Vertical Line Test for a Function
According to the law of function, if there's a x and multiple output y values, it is not a function. On the graph, this law could be tested through question if a vertical line could be able to intersect graph multiple times. If instersecting multiple times, then it's not a function. 

### Piecewise-Defined Functions
Absolute value function could be a typical example of this, which means a function could have different formulas on different parts of its domain.

$$
|x| = \begin{cases} x,\ x \geq 0 \\ -x,\ x < 0 \end{cases}
$$

### Increasing and Decreasing Functions

><h3>Definition</h3>
>
>Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval $I$ and let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two distinct points in $I$.
>
> 1. If $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$, then $f$ is said to be **increasing** on $I$
> 2. If $f(x_2) < f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$, then $f$ is said to be **decreasing** on $I$

### Even Functions and Odd Functions Symmetry

> <h3>Definitions</h3>
>
> A function $y = f(x)$ is an
>
>     **even function of x** if $f(-x) = f(x)$
> 
>     **odd funciton of x** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$
> for every $x$ in the function's domain.
