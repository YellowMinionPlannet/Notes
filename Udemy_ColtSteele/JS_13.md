# Section 13: Web Storage APIs
## LocalStorage Basic
[Pitchfork]()

```js
console.log(localStorage)
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
localStorage.getItem("key");
localStorage.removeItem("key");
localStorage.clear();
```

## LocalStorage with Complex Objects
When we try to store some array, it will be automatically transfered into String type.

```js
const nums = [1,2,3,4];
localStorage.setItem("nums", nums);
console.log(localStorage);//
localStorage.getItem("nums");// '1,2,3,4'
```

What we can do is using JSON.

```js
const nums = [1,2,3,4];
localStorage.setItem("nums", JSON.stringify(nums));
const numsCopy = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("nums"));
```

## What Should & Should Not Go In LocalStorage
## storage event for localStorage
We can use this event to sync states among different windows under the same website session.(same url)
```js
window.addEventListener("storage", (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

## sessionStorage
If you open another tab / window, the current page's session storage is lost.
