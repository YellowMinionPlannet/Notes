# Section 5: Natours Project - Using Advanced CSS and Sass(part 2)
## Review: Responsive Design Principles and Layout Types
1. Fluid Layouts
    * to allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width or even height
    * use % or vh vw unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport
    * use max-width instead of width
2. Reponsive Units
    * use rem unit instead of px for most length
    * to make it easy to scale the entire layout down or up
3. Flexible Images
    * By default, images don't scale as we change the viewport
    * always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width
4. Media Queries
    * to change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints)

### Layout types
1. float layouts
