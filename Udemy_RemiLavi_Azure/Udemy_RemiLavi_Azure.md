# Concept of Cloud Compute:
![Cloud_Compute](./Cloud_Compute.png)

* 4 types of Compute Services:
    - Virtual Machines
    - App Services
    - AKS
    - Azure Functions

# Virtual Machines
It's a (not real) server which runs on top of real (physical)server.

We use this in IaaS.

The physical layer is completely managed by Azure, we can do nothing about it.

We can do things in Virtual layer.

- Steps for Creating VM in Azureï¼š
    - Select the location
    - Select the image (OS + Pre-Installed of the software)
    - Select the size
    - CHECK THE PRICE FOR YOUR PLAN/SUBSCRIPTION.


- To Check the price, use pricing calculator in Azure

- Concept of VNet and Subnet is in future course.

- When creating VM choose RDP as port,  remote desktop port.

## The Real Cost of VM
1. VM
2. Disk
3. IP
4. Storage Account

## Reduce the cost of VM
There are some tech to do this:
1. Auto shutdown
    - Option for VM when creating
2. Reserved Instances
    - Means you reserve a machine in future, the fee is charged even if you don't use it. Fee could be charged monthly, but you need to pay upfront.
3. Spot instances
    - Machines run on unused capacity, but will be shut down anytime when azure requires.
    - you can choose to stop your machine, or completely deleted when Azure requires a recycle.
4. Disk optimization
    - Most of time, Azure choose Premium SSD for the disk of VM.

## Availability of a VM

- Microsoft have SLA(service level agreement) with guarantees for availability of VM.
